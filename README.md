## Contributions
contributions are welcome. I did get some help with this in an extra study session with Charlie and Austin.

## Tests
Test the code by starting the server. You can do so by using the command `npm run server:dev`. After that you should open another terminal and run `npm run test` doing this will run the component test 'Quiz.cy.tsx' and the e2e test 'quiz.cy.ts'. With the sever still running, you're able to run `npm run cypress` if installed. It will open cypres, from there you're able to do the Component and e2e test.
