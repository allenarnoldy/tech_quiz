contributions are welcome. I did get some help with this in an extra study session with Charlie and Austin.

Tests
Test the code by starting the server. You can do so by using the command `npm run server:dev`. After that you should open another terminal and run `npm run test` doing this will run the component test 'Quiz.cy.tsx' and the e2e test 'quiz.cy.ts'. With the sever still running, you're able to run `npm run cypress` if installed. It will open cypres, from there you're able to do the Component and e2e test.
